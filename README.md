# Full-Adder-Perceptrons

NAND is an universal logic gate which implies that any digital circuit can be bulit by just using this type of gate.

The behavior of the NAND gate is followed by this truth table:

Perceptron are the equivalent when it comes to builing up neuronal networks.
By using Weights equals to -2 and bias qual to 3 it can be noted that Perceptrons can bulid equivalent NAND gates according to a selected threshold.

In this code, a binary full adder is implemented just by the using of perceptrons and the threshold is selected by a grid of different options to select the one that gives the higher accuracy
